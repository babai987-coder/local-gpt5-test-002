# Quote Generator (with Category Filters)

## Overview
A lightweight, single-file web app that displays inspirational quotes. It now includes a category dropdown (e.g., Motivation, Life, Success) so you can filter quotes by topic. The randomize button continues to work, delivering a new quote from the selected category (or from all quotes if “All Categories” is chosen).

## Setup
- No build tools required.
- Download or clone the repository and open index.html in any modern web browser.

## Usage
- Use the Category dropdown to pick a topic:
  - All Categories (default)
  - Motivation
  - Life
  - Success
- Click the New Quote button to get a random quote from the currently selected category.
- Optional shortcut: press R to randomize.

## Improvements from previous version (Round 2)
- Added a category filter with a dropdown menu.
- Randomization now respects the selected category.
- Updated the quote dataset to include category metadata.
- UI improvements for better readability and accessibility.
